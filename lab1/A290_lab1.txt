[1] console.log("    ___\n   ('v')\n  ((   ))\n-/-\"---\"--\n"); // [ 1]
prints four spaces and three underscores on first line, line break with \n
prints three spaces and ('v') on second line, line break with \n
prints two spaces and ((   )) on third line, line break with \n
prints -/-"---"-- on fourth line, since \" inside string is the character ", line break with \n
ends with an empty line with the last \n
everything after // is comment
The console will print:
    ___
   ('v')
  ((   ))
-/-"---"--

[2] console.log( Infinity + 3 );                                 // [ 2]
The console will print Infinity since infinity + 3 is still infinity.

[3] console.log( typeof Infinity );                              // [ 3]
The console will print number since the type of infinity is number.

[4] console.log( typeof 4.5 );                                   // [ 4]
The console will print number since the type of 4.5 is number.

[5] console.log( typeof 3 );                                     // [ 5]
The console will print number since the type of 3 is number.

[6] console.log( 3 / 0 );                                        // [ 6]
The console will print Infinity since 3 divided by 0 diverges to infinity.

[7] console.log( -3 / 0 );                                       // [ 7]
The console will print -Infinity since -3 divided by 0 diverges to negative infinity.

[8] console.log( Infinity - Infinity );                          // [ 8]
The console will print NaN since Infinity - Infinity does not yield meaningful results.

[9] console.log( 0 / 0 );                                        // [ 9]
The console will print NaN since 0 / 0 does not yield meaningful results.

[10] console.log( typeof NaN );                                   // [10]
The console will print number since NaN is a value of the type number that stands for “not a number”.

[11] console.log( Math.random() < 0.5 ? "heads" : "tails" );      // [11]
Math.random() gives a random number in [0, 1)
If Math.random() has a value less than 0.5, the value on the left of ? is true, prints heads;
if Math.random() has a value greater than 0.5, the value on the left of ? is false, prints tails.
The console will print randomly heads or tails depending on the value of Math.random()

[12] console.log( typeof undefined );                             // [12]
The console will print undefined since it is the type undefined.

[13] console.log( typeof null );                                  // [13]
The console will print object since it is the type object.

[14] console.log(8 * null);                                       // [14]
The console will print 0 since null is automatically converted to number 0, and 8 * 0 is 0

[15] console.log("5" - 1);                                        // [15]
The console will print 4 since string "5" is automatically converted to number 5, and 5 - 1 is 4

[16] console.log("5" + 1);                                        // [16]
Because + tries concatenation before numeric addition, 1 is converted to string "1". Concatenation of "5" and "1" is "51"
The console will print "51"

[17] console.log("couch" * 2);                                    // [17]
The console will print NaN because the string "couch" cannot be converted to number, the result is meaningless.

[18] console.log(false == 0);                                     // [18]
The console will print true because of automatic type conversion, and false equals to logical number 0.

[19] console.log(null == undefined);                              // [19]
The console will print true because of automatic type conversion, and both null and undefined denote the absence of a meaningful value.

[20] console.log(null == 0);                                      // [20]
The console will print false because null is an object of empty value while 0 is a number.

[21] console.log(undefined == 0);                                 // [21]
The console will print false because undefined stands for empty value while 0 is a number.

[22] console.log(null || "user");                                 // [22]
The console will print user since null cannot be converted to true, so the operator || will return the value on its right.

[23] console.log("Karl" || "user");                               // [23]
The console will print Karl since it can be converted to true, the operator || will return the value on the left when it is true.

[24] console.log(undefined || "tomato");                          // [24]
The console will print tomato since undefined is converted to false and "tomato" can be converted to true, the operator || will return the value on the right when the value to its left is false and the value to its right is true.

[25] console.log("tomato" && "pasta");                            // [25]
The console will print "pasta" since both "tomato" and "pasta" are logically true, the operator && will return the value to the right when both values are true.

2.

[1] var a = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) - 50
Math.random() * 100 is a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) times 100. This line of code creates variable a that is the largest integer smaller than or equal to that number, and minus 50.

[2] var b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) - 50
Creates another variable b using the same procedure but different random number

[3] console.log( a + " " + b )
Prints a string concatenating a, an empty space, and b.

[4] a = a + b
Sets the value of a to a + b

[5] b = a - b
Sets the value of b to a - b. The value of a here is the ending result of line [4]

[6] a = a - b
set the value of a to a - b. The value of a and b is the ending result of line [4] and [5] respectively.

[7] console.log( a + " " + b )
Prints a string concatenating a, an empty space and b. The value of a and b is the ending result of line [6] and [5] respectively.

3.

[1] -bash-4.2$ cat seven.js
prints content inside the file seven.js

[2] console.log( new Number("32") + 6 );
new Number("32") creates a number 32
The console will print 38 since 32 + 6 is 38.

[3] console.log( isNaN(3/0) );
The console will print false since 3/0 is Infinity, and isNaN(Infinity) returns false because Infinity is not NaN.

[4] console.log("sunderland".charAt(3));
The console will print d since "sunderland".charAt(3) returns the character at index position 3 (couting from 0) from the string "sunderland".

[5] console.log("sunderland".charAt("sunderland".length-1));
"sunderland".length is the length of string "sunderland", 10.
The console will print d since "sunderland".charAt(3) returns the character at index position 9 (since 10 - 1 is 9) from the string "sunderland".

[6] console.log("sunderland".substring(1, 6));
The console will print under since "sunderland".substring(1, 6) returns a substring of "sunderland" between index position 1 (inclusive) and 6 (exclusive).

[7] console.log("sunderland".substring(6));
The console will print land since "sunderland".substring(6) returns a substring of "sunderland" between index position 6 (inclusive) and "sunderland".length (exclusive).

[8] -bash-4.2$
nothing
